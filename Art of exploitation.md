The first four registers (EAX ,  ECX ,  EDX , and  EBX ) are known as general-purpose registers. These are called the Accumulator,  Counter,  Data , and  Base  
registers, respectively. They are used for a variety of purposes, but they mainly 
act as temporary variables for the CPU when it is executing machine 
instructions.
The second four registers ( ESP ,  EBP ,  ESI, and  EDI ) are also general-purpose registers, but they are sometimes known as pointers and indexes. 
These stand for Stack Pointer,  Base Pointer ,  Source Index , and  Destination Index, 
respectively. The first two registers are called pointers because they store 32-bit 
addresses, which essentially point to that location in memory. These registers 
are fairly important to program execution and memory management.The last two registers are also technically pointers
which are commonly used to point to the source and destination when data 
needs to be read from or written to. There are load and store instructions 
that use these registers, but for the most part, these registers can be thought 
of as just simple general-purpose registers


 However, 
the first ex amine shows the first two bytes to be 0xc7 and 0x45, but when a 
halfword is examined at the exact same memory address, the value  0x45c7 is 
shown, with the bytes reversed. This same byte-reversal effect can be seen 
when a full four-byte word is shown as 0x00fc45c7 , but when the first four bytes 
are shown byte by byte, they are in the order of  0xc7,  0x45,  0xfc, and  0x00.
This is because on the x 86 processor values are stored in  little-endian 
byte order , which means the least significant byte is stored first. For example, 
if four bytes are to be interpreted as a single value, the bytes must be used 
in reverse order. The GDB debugger is smart enough to know how values 
are stored, so when a word or halfword is examined, the bytes must be 
reversed to display the correct values in hexadecimal.
