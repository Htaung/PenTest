Installation about ubuntu on vbox


    Start your virtual machine

    On Virtualbox menu -> Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD image...

    From Ubuntu you should see a popup, allow the CD autorun to install the program. For me, like many times before, it said he could not find Linux headers but, this time, in the end everything went fine.
    If the autorun does not work, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), navigate to folder (usually /media/VBOXADDITIONS*) and run

    sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

    Shut down and then start again your virtual machine
